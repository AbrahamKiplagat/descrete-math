Your proof has the right idea and the conclusion is correct, but there are some technical mistakes in the logical derivation and notation. Let me break it down step by step to clarify.

### Step 1: Definition of Set Difference
You wrote:
```
A−B ⇔ (x ∈ A) ∧ (x ∉ B)
```
This is not quite correct because:
- `A - B` is a **set**, while `(x ∈ A) ∧ (x ∉ B)` is a **logical statement** about an element `x`. They cannot be directly equivalent.
- The proper definition should specify that this holds **for all** elements `x`. It should be:
  \[
  x \in (A - B) \iff (x \in A) \land (x \notin B)
  \]
  This means: "An element \(x\) is in \(A - B\) if and only if \(x\) is in \(A\) and not in \(B\)."

### Step 2: Incorrect Equivalence
You then wrote:
```
⇔ x ∈ A
```
This is a mistake because:
- From \(x \in (A - B) \iff (x \in A) \land (x \notin B)\), it is true that if \(x \in (A - B)\), then \(x \in A\). However:
  - The converse is not true: \(x \in A\) does not imply \(x \in (A - B)\), because \(x\) could be in both \(A\) and \(B\) (i.e., \(x \in A \land x \in B\)), which means \(x \notin (A - B)\).
- Therefore, \((x \in A) \land (x \notin B)\) implies \(x \in A\), but it is **not equivalent** to \(x \in A\) alone. The equivalence you wrote (\(\iff\)) is too strong and incorrect.

### Step 3: Correct Subset Conclusion
You concluded:
```
∴ (A−B) ⊆ A
```
This is **correct**, but the derivation to get here was flawed. Here's the proper way to prove it:
- Let \(x\) be an arbitrary element.
- If \(x \in (A - B)\), then by definition, \(x \in A \land x \notin B\), which implies \(x \in A\).
- Since \(x\) was arbitrary, this shows that for all \(x\), if \(x \in (A - B)\), then \(x \in A\).
- Therefore, \((A - B) \subseteq A\).

So, the conclusion \((A - B) \subseteq A\) is valid, but it relies on the implication (not equivalence) from the definition.

### Step 4: Power Set Definition
You wrote:
```
And powersets are the family of subsets in A
```
This is a bit informal but essentially correct. The power set of \(A\), denoted \(\mathcal{P}(A)\), is defined as the set of all subsets of \(A\):
\[
\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ S \mid S \subseteq A \}
\]

### Step 5: Power Set Membership Conclusion
You concluded:
```
∴ (A−B) ∈ P(A)
```
This is **correct** because:
- You have shown that \((A - B) \subseteq A\).
- By the definition of \(\mathcal{P}(A)\), any subset of \(A\) is an element of \(\mathcal{P}(A)\).
- Therefore, \((A - B) \in \mathcal{P}(A)\).

### Summary of Issues and Corrections
- **Main Mistake**: You incorrectly treated the logical implication as an equivalence in Step 2. Specifically, \((x \in A) \land (x \notin B)\) implies \(x \in A\), but it is not equivalent to it. This made the derivation invalid, even though the final subset conclusion was correct.
- **Notation Issue**: In Step 1, you mixed set notation with logical statements. Always define set operations in terms of element membership (e.g., using \(x \in \text{set}\)).
- **Implicit Quantification**: You didn't explicitly state that \(x\) is arbitrary or use quantifiers (like \(\forall x\)). This can lead to ambiguity. In set proofs, it's good practice to start with "Let \(x\) be arbitrary" or similar.

### Corrected Proof
Here's how the full proof should be written clearly and correctly:

1. **Prove \((A - B) \subseteq A\)**:
   - Let \(x\) be an arbitrary element.
   - If \(x \in (A - B)\), then by the definition of set difference, \(x \in A \land x \notin B\).
   - Therefore, \(x \in A\).
   - Since \(x\) was arbitrary, this shows that \((A - B) \subseteq A\).

2. **Prove \((A - B) \in \mathcal{P}(A)\)**:
   - The power set \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) is defined as \(\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ S \mid S \subseteq A \}\).
   - Since \((A - B) \subseteq A\), it follows that \((A - B) \in \mathcal{P}(A)\).

This version is logically sound and avoids the mistakes in your original derivation. The key is to distinguish between implication (\(\implies\)) and equivalence (\(\iff\)), and to use proper set notation. Good job on the core idea—just watch the logical details!
