Here’s how you can represent **Venn Diagrams in Markdown (.md)** using **text-based ASCII art** or by embedding an image.

### ✅ Option 1: Simple Text-Based Venn Diagram (2 Sets)

```md
## Venn Diagram of Sets A and B

            _________
           /         \     
          /    A      \     
         /             \     
        /               \______
       \                /      \
        \              /   B    \
         \            /         /
          \__________/_________/

## Legend:
- A ∩ B = elements common to both
- A ∪ B = all elements from both sets
- A - B = only in A, not in B
- B - A = only in B, not in A
```

### ✅ Option 2: Embed an Actual Venn Diagram Using Markdown

You can create an image (e.g. in [draw.io](https://draw.io), [canva.com](https://canva.com), or export from Desmos) and embed it:

```md
## Venn Diagram Example

![Venn Diagram of Sets A and B](./venn-diagram.png)

### Definitions:
- A = {1, 2, 3}
- B = {3, 4, 5}
- A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- A ∩ B = {3}
- A - B = {1, 2}
```

### ✅ Option 3: GitHub-Flavored Markdown Table for Set Relations

```md
| Operation        | Symbol     | Result         |
|------------------|------------|----------------|
| Union            | A ∪ B      | {1,2,3,4,5}     |
| Intersection     | A ∩ B      | {3}            |
| Difference (A-B) | A - B      | {1,2}          |
| Difference (B-A) | B - A      | {4,5}          |
| Symmetric Diff   | A △ B      | {1,2,4,5}      |
```

Would you like me to generate and provide a downloadable `.png` or `.svg` Venn diagram image that you can include in your Markdown file?
